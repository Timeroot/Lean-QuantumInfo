Each of the items below is an item in Mark Wilde's book, "Quantum Information Theory". The following emoji indicate possible status:
 * ✅ - Completed, and proved with no sorries.
 * 📝 - All required definitions are present and the question is stated / the theorem is in a form that could be used, but it is unproved / depends on sorries.
 * ❓ - This has not yet been stated or fully defined.
 * 🤷 - This is unlikely / undesirable to be formalized.
 * 😂 - This didn't need to be proved, because it was just the definition (or something similar).
 * 🤔 - This is not a fact in the book but something related that would be nice to have (and we don't have yet).

There's very little from Chapters 2 or 3 to include right now. Chapter 2 is an intuitive (and less rigorous) overview of classical coding theory. Chapter 3 is a lot of practice of qubit computations, and we haven't worked the special case fo qubits yet much.

# Chapter 2 - Classical Shannon Theory
Exercise 2.1.1: The entropy of a uniform variable is `log |X|`, where `|X|` is the size of the variable's alphabet.
 ✅ `Hₛ_uniform` in `ClassicalInfo.Entropy`.

Property 2.1.1, 2.1.2, 2.1.3: Basic properties of typical sets.
🤷 Typical sets aren't defined until Chapter 14, we will prove things then.

Exercise 2.2.1: If the average (across codewords) probability of a codeword C getting incorrectly decoded is ε, then by Markov's inequality least half of the codewords have at most 2ε of incorrect decoding.
🤷 `ENNReal.finset_card_const_le_le_of_tsum_le` states the interesting bit (Markov's inequality for finite set cardinalities), the application to codewords will come when we need it.

# Chapter 3 - The Noiseless Quantum Theory
Bras, Kets
✅ `Bra` and `Ket` in `QuantumInfo.Finite.Braket`.

Exercise 3.2.1: Determine the Bloch sphere angles for the states ∣-〉and ∣+〉.
❓ Eventually we'll define qubits, basic states like these, and the Bloch sphere, and can add lemmas for these.

Excercise 3.3.1: A linear operator unitary iff it is norm-preserving.
❓ This is stated for linear operators as `unitary.linearIsometryEquiv`, and the "only if" is more explicitly as `unitary.norm_map`. Would be good to have for `Matrix.unitaryGroup`.

_There's a whole bunch about Pauli matrices. We haven't specialized to qubits yet, so these are all ❓._

Exercise 3.3.2: Find a matrix representation of `[X,Z]` in the basis ∣0〉, ∣1〉.
Exercise 3.3.3: Show that the Pauli matrices are all Hermitian, unitary, and square to the identity, and their eigenvalues are ±1.
Exercise 3.3.4: Represent the eigenstates of the Y operator in the standard computational basis.
Exercise 3.3.5: Show that the Paulis either commute or anticommute.
Exercise 3.3.6: With σi, i=0..3, show that Tr{σi σj} = δij.
Exercise 3.3.7: Matrix representation of Hadamard gate.
Exercise 3.3.8: Hadamard is its own inverse.
Exercise 3.3.9: A particular exercise in changing bases; this is 🤷.
Exercise 3.3.10: HXH = Z and HZH=X. _Sure, if we make simp lemmas for Clifford products this can be in there._

Definition 3.3.1: Function of a Hermitian operator (by a function on its spectrum). 
❓ This we definitely would like, currently they're all ad-hoc.

Exercise 3.3.11: Explicit forms for rotation operators.
❓ Requires Bloch sphere and rotation gates. Will probably be the definitions of them.

Postulate: Born rule.
✅ We have `MState.measure` which has this baked in. But we could also have it for bras and kets.

Definition: von Neumann measurement. A POVM that is not just projective, but given by an orthonormal basis.
❓ Could be a nice Prop on POVMs.

Exercise 3.4.1: POVM associated to the X operator measurement.
❓ Definitely want this.

Exercise 3.4.2, 3.4.3: Asking (something like) `〈ψ∣H∣ψ〉= Ex[H.measure (pure ψ)]`.
❓ Definitely want to prove. Doesn't need qubits, either.

Uncertainty principle
❓ Could do the state-dependent version given in the book. The averaged-case expectation value one comes as a result. But this would require defining + working with the Haar measure over kets.

Exercise 3.4.4, 3.4.5: Longish story about uncertainty princple.
🤷 Won't prove the thing asked, it's a very specific thing. 

Exercise 3.5.1: This is askings for products of operators on qubits as tensor products.
😂 This is precisely how we define it to start with.

Exercise 3.5.2: Asking that`〈ξ1⊗ξ2‖ψ1⊗ψ2〉=〈ξ1‖ψ1〉〈ξ2‖ψ2〉`.
❓ Basic fact about braket products types.

Exercise 3.5.3: Matrix representation of CNOT gate as [1,0,0,0;0,1...] etc.
❓ If we define "CNOT" as "Controlled(X)", this could potentially be a fact to give.

Exercise 3.5.4: Prove `(H⊗H)(CNOT)(H⊗H) = |+⟩⟨+|⊗I + |-⟩⟨-|⊗Z`.
🤷 Very specific equality.

Exercise 3.5.5: `CNOT(1→2)` commutes with `CNOT(1→3)`.
Exercise 3.5.6: `CNOT(2→1)` commutes with `CNOT(3→1)`.
❓ Depending on how we define the qubits to a gate, might be fine (in which case let's do the generic one for any controlled gate), or a pain.

No-Cloning theorem (for unitaries): There is no unitary that clones perfectly from |ψ0⟩ to |ψ0⟩.
❓ Should be easy to state and prove.
🤔 No-Cloning theorem (for channels): There is no channel that clones perfectly from ρ to ρ⊗ρ.
🤔 Proving the bounds on the optimal universal quantum clone (5/6 fidelity etc.)

Exercise 3.5.7: Orthogonal states can be perfectly cloned.
❓ Stated for two orthogonal qubit states, we'll prove for orthogonal sets of qudits.

❓

Exercise 3.6.1, 3.6.2: The Bell state = `( |++⟩ + |--⟩ )/√2`. This means shared randomness in Z or X basis.
🤷 Too specific. _Could_ say something like "the Bell state is identical in many bases", which is Exercise 3.7.12.

Exercise 3.6.3: Cloning implies signalling.
🤷 If we can prove that cloning doesn't exist, this gives an immediate exfalso proof, so this isn't interesting.

CHSH Game
❓ Defining it, giving optimal classical and quantum strategies.

Exercise 3.6.5, 3.66, 3.6.7: Numerical exercises with Bell states.
🤷 Maybe just defining Bell states as a basis for 2-qubit states.

Exercise 3.7.1 - 3.7.11: Lemmas about qudit X and Z operators.
❓ Sure, if we define them.

Exercise 3.7.12: "Transpose trick" for Bell state |Φ⟩, that `(U⊗I)|Φ⟩=(I⊗Uᵀ)|Φ⟩`.

Definition 4.2.1: POVMs as PSD matrices that sum to the identity.
✅ `POVM` in `QuantumInfo.Finite.POVM`.

Exercise 4.2.1: The five "Chrysler" states on a qubit, scaled down by (2/5), form a POVM.
🤷 Very specific.

Exercise 4.2.2(a): Suppose an ensemble ρ_X has a bound τ, so that ∀(x ∈ X), τ ≽ p_x ρ(x). Then the maximum expected probability of a POVM identifying x from the distribution is at most Tr[τ].
Exercise 4.2.2(b): In a d dimensional ensemble, no more than d possible symbols can be lossessly stored.
❓ Seems unlikely to be used later but fine to state and prove.

Definition 4.3.1: Product State (density operator).
✅ `MState.prod` in `QuantumInfo.Finite.MState` constructs product states. No predicate form.

Exercise 4.3.1(a): `ρ.purity = (U_swap * ρ ⊗ ρ).trace`.
Exercise 4.3.1(b): For an operator function `f`, `Tr[f(ρ)] = ( f(ρ) ⊗ I(d) ).swap.trace`.
❓ Should be an easy index chase.

Exercise 4.3.2: Just a step of a scenario, not really a theorem.
