Finite dimensional quantum mixed states, ρ.

The same comments apply as in `Braket`:

These could be done with a Hilbert space of Fintype, which would look like
```lean4
(H : Type*) [NormedAddCommGroup H] [InnerProductSpace ℂ H] [CompleteSpace H] [FiniteDimensional ℂ H]
```
or by choosing a particular `Basis` and asserting it is `Fintype`. But frankly it seems easier to
mostly focus on the basis-dependent notion of `Matrix`, which has the added benefit of an obvious
"classical" interpretation (as the basis elements, or diagonal elements of a mixed state). In that
sense, this quantum theory comes with the a particular classical theory always preferred.

Important definitions:
 * `instMixable`: the `Mixable` instance allowing convex combinations of `MState`s
 * `ofClassical`: Mixed states representing classical distributions
 * `purity`: The purity `Tr[ρ^2]` of a state
 * `spectrum`: The spectrum of the matrix
 * `uniform`: The maximally mixed state
 * `mix`: The total state corresponding to an ensemble
 * `average`: Averages a function over an ensemble, with appropriate weights
