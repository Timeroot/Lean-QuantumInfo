/-! # Inner product of Hermitian Matrices

For general matrices there are multiple reasonable notions of "inner product" (Hilbert–Schmidt inner product,
Frobenius inner product), and so Mathlib avoids giving a canonical `InnerProductSpace` instance. But for the
particular case of Hermitian matrices, these all coincide, so we can put a canonical `InnerProductSpace`
instance.

This _does_ however induce a `Norm` on `HermitianMat` as well, the Frobenius norm, and this is less obviously
a uniquely correct choice. It is something that one essentially has to live with, with the way that Mathlib
currently structures the instances. (Thankfully, all norms induce the same _topology and bornology_ on
finite-dimensional matrices.)

Some care to be taken so that the topology induced by the InnerProductSpace is defeq with the Subtype
topology that HermitianMat inherits from the topology on Matrix. This can be done via
`InnerProductSpace.ofCoreOfTopology`.

It *should* be easier than this to construct the resulting `InnerProductSpace`. But there's a rub!

An InnerProductSpace gives a natural topology, uniformity, and bornology (all of which carry data);
but `HermitianMat` already inherits a topology and uniformity from `Matrix` and `Subtype`. (Thankfully,
not a Bornology, although that could change in the future as Mathlib develops.) This can lead to
issues where many theorems (or other types, like `CompleteSpace`) expect the uniformity structure
to be defeq to the one coming from the `InnerProductSpace`.

This is why constructors like `InnerProductSpace.ofCoreOfTopology` exist, which let you override the
topology when you create it. You need to give a proof that it's propositionally equivalent, which
is what the `topo_compat_1` / `2` / `uniformity_compat` theorems do.

But there's a second issue. There a function for overriding the uniformity, or the bornology, or
"all" of them ... which, oddly, means just the uniformity + bornology. Probably a relic of how it
developed, and topology overrides were added later. This means we can't override the topology
_and_ the uniformity, even though we need both.

Eventually this should be fixed in Mathlib. But for now, it means we have to recreate the `ofCore`
somewhat, adding in the overrides to the construction manually. This is why
`instNormedGroup`, `instNormedSpace`, and `instInnerProductSpace` are so long and messy, and each
repeats some proof from Mathlib.
