/-- The Hamiltonian for a microcanonical ensemble, parameterized by any extrinsic parameters of data D.
  Since it's an arbitrary type, 'T' would be nice, but we use 'D' for data to avoid confusion with temperature.
  We define Hamiltonians as an energy function on a real manifold, whose dimension n possibly depends on the data D.
  Energy is a WithTop ℝ, ⊤ is used to mean "excluded as a possibility in phase space".
  This formalization does exclude the possibility of discrete degrees of freedom; it is not _completely_ general.
  A better formalization could have an arbitrary measurable space.
